As we all our known with the word stock market in which stocks of the commodities, currencies & many more are traded/exchanged. I personally have a great interest in Stock market so i thought of working on it. I took this dataset from kaggle. I chose Reliance stocks for analysing.

This dataset consist of the reliance stocks highs and lows, opening price, previous closing price. 
In this dataset i have analyzed about their stocks by using pandas for cleaning and preparation and also i have used matplotlib and seaborn tools for visualizing of data.
